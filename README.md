# Crop Recommendation Dataset Analysis

This project provides an end-to-end analysis and prediction model for the **Crop Recommendation Dataset** from Kaggle. The primary goal is to recommend the most suitable crop based on various soil and climate conditions using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset can be accessed and downloaded from [Kaggle's Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset). It includes the following features:
- **N**: Nitrogen content in the soil
- **P**: Phosphorous content in the soil
- **K**: Potassium content in the soil
- **Temperature**: In degrees Celsius
- **Humidity**: Percentage
- **pH**: pH level of the soil
- **Rainfall**: In mm
- **Label**: Recommended crop (target variable)

## Project Overview

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset from Kaggle or local storage.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and standardize data for optimal model performance.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the distribution and relationships between variables.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Transform data if needed to improve model performance.
5. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict the recommended crop.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Requirements

To run this project, install the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `plotly`
- `scikit-learn`
- `kaggle` (for downloading the dataset)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set up Kaggle API

1. Install the Kaggle package (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install kaggle
